# French-Wine-Map

An interactive map to vizualise the wine production in France thanks to [D3.js](https://d3js.org/). My first project with D3.js. The basic display shows the volume of the different types of wines (red, white, ros√©, cognac). By clicking on a department you can zoom and see the surfaces of the cultures dedicated to the different protected (or not) designations.

See it [here](https://alxclt.github.io/Dataviz-French_Wines_Map/vin.html) 

Data source: [French government's open data portal](http://www.data.gouv.fr/)

Enjoy!
